1. Check whether the number is fascinating or not. When a number( 3 digits or more ) is multiplied by 2 and 3, and when both these products are concatenated with the original number, then it results in all digits from 1 to 9 present exactly once. There could be any number of zeros and are ignored.
2. A Kaprekar number is a number in which the sqaure of the number is split into two parts and the sum of those two parts is equal to number. For e.x- 452=2025 -> 20 + 45 == 45, 2972=88209 -> 88 + 209 == 297.
3. Enter a number and check if it is a smith number. A Smith number is a number in which the sum of digits of a number is equal to sum digits of the prime factors(excluding 1) of that number.
4. A triangular number is formed by the addition of consecutive integers starting with 1. Print all triangular numbers in range of 3 to n.
5. Enter a number and check if it is a Duck number. A number containing one or more zeroes is a duck number.
6. Given a date, check if it is valid or not. It may be assumed that the given date is in range from 01/01/1800 to 31/12/9999.
7. Write a program to input a date in ddmmyyyy 8 digit format and print it in 1) dd / mm / yyyy format 2) dd, month name , yyyy format.
8. Write a program to accept the year, month and the weekday name of the 1st day of that month and generate its calendar.
9. Write a program to accept 2 dates in the string format dd/mm/yyyy and find the difference in days between the 2 dates.
10. Given a time in numbers we can convert it into words. For example :
    5 : 00 —— five o’clock
    5 : 10 —— ten minutes past five
    5 : 15 —— quarter past five
    5 : 30 —— half past five
    5 : 40 —— twenty minutes to six
    5 : 45 —— quarter to six
    5 : 47 —— thirteen minutes to six
    Write a program which first inputs two integers, the first between 1 and 12 (both inclusive) and second between 0 and 59 (both inclusive) and then prints out the time they represent, in words.
11. Checking saddle point of Matrix MxM. Saddle point is where value is min in rows and max in columns.
12. A Wonderous Square is a n by n matrix. _ It contains Integers from 1 to n2, where each integer appears only once. _ The sum of integers in any row or column should add upto in any row or column should add upto 0.5\*n(n2+1)
13. Write a program to implement Matric Multiplication.
14. A square matrix is the matrix in which number of rows equals the number of columns. Thus, a matrix of order n\*n is called a Square Matrix. Write a program in Java to create a double dimensional array of size nxn matrix form and fill the numbers in a circular fashion (anticlock-wise) with natural numbers from 1 to n2, taking n as an input. The filling of the elements should start from outer to the central cell.
15. Given a square matrix M[][] of order 'n'. The maximum value possible for 'n' is 10. Accept three different characters from the keyboard and fill the array according to the output shown in the examples. If the value of n exceeds 10 then an appropriate message should be displayed.
16. A class Rearrange has been defined to modify a word by bringing all the vowels in the word at the beginning followed by the consonants.
17. Count the frequency of Words starting with Capital Letter in a sentence.
18. A class SwapSort to swap first and last characters of a word and print it, and also sort the alphabets and print it.
19. Print String Fibonacci Series, staring with "a" and "b".
20. Exchange the first and last letters of words in a sentence.
    Example: -
    Input: Java is the one of the most hated language
    Output: aavJ si eht eno fo ehh tosm dateh eanguagl
21. Shift a Matrix up by one row.
22. A bank intends to design a program to display the denomination of an input amount, up to 5 digits. The available denomination with the bank are of rupees 2000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10 and 1
23. Make a Linked list to Enter numbers and sort them.
24. Parenthesis matching using Stack.
25. Infix Expression to Postfix Expression Converter. Example l*(p+f*(d+g)) -> lpfdg+*+*
